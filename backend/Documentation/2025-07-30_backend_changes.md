## Specific New Architecture Implemented on 2025-07-30

### 1. Parallel Execution Architecture
- **Previous (2025-07-28)**: Sequential workflow with single-threaded processing
- **Current (2025-07-30)**: Parallel execution with two concurrent paths:
  - **Path 1**: `llm_tagger → unmute` (Voice streaming)
  - **Path 2**: `llm_tagger → processing_router → [appropriate_node]` (Agent processing)
- **Improvement**: Eliminates waiting time between voice response and agent processing

### 2. Enhanced Unmute Node (Complete Rewrite)
- **Previous**: Simple message sending to Unmute
- **Current**: Full-featured streaming node with:
  - **Direct Websocket Connection**: Uses `websockets` library for real-time communication
  - **Response.create Trigger**: Explicitly triggers response generation
  - **Real-time Streaming**: Streams both text and audio chunks to frontend
  - **Session Management**: Handles session initialization and voice configuration
  - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and timeout management
  - **Status Updates**: Multiple streaming status messages for frontend feedback

#### Key Features:
```python
# Session initialization with health assistant instructions
session_message = {
    "type": "session.update",
    "session": {
        "instructions": {"type": "constant", "text": "You are a helpful health assistant."},
        "voice": "unmute-prod-website/developer-1.mp3",
        "allow_recording": True
    }
}

# Response generation trigger
response_create_message = {"type": "response.create"}

# Real-time chunk streaming
send_streaming_chunk("text_chunk", {"text": text_chunk, "source": "unmute"})
send_streaming_chunk("audio_chunk", {"audio": audio_chunk, "source": "unmute"})
```

### 3. Processing Router Node (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Routes to appropriate processing nodes while Unmute streams in parallel
- **Function**: Determines next processing step based on route_tag
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs concurrently with Unmute streaming
- **Routing Logic**:
  - `text` → `semantic_precheck`
  - `patient` → `patient`
  - `web` → `web`
  - `medical` → `semantic_update`
  - `ui_change/add_treatment` → `ui_change`

### 4. Streaming API Endpoint (NEW)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/agent/stream`
- **Method**: POST with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Purpose**: Real-time communication between backend and frontend
- **Features**:
  - **Request-specific Queues**: Each request gets its own streaming queue
  - **Chunk-based Streaming**: Sends individual chunks as they become available
  - **Status Updates**: Multiple status messages for connection, processing, completion
  - **Error Streaming**: Real-time error reporting
  - **CORS Support**: Full CORS headers for cross-origin requests

#### Streaming Chunk Types:
- `streaming_started`: Initial processing status
- `unmute_connecting`: Voice assistant connection attempt
- `unmute_connected`: Successful voice connection
- `unmute_streaming_started`: Voice response generation started
- `text_chunk`: Individual text chunks from voice response
- `audio_chunk`: Individual audio chunks from voice response
- `text_complete`: Text response finished
- `audio_complete`: Audio response finished
- `unmute_complete`: Full voice response complete
- `workflow_complete`: Agent processing complete
- `workflow_error`: Error in agent processing

### 5. Enhanced Workflow Architecture
- **Previous**: Linear workflow with single execution path
- **Current**: Parallel workflow with multiple execution paths

#### New Workflow Structure:
```
llm_tagger
├── unmute (parallel path)
└── processing_router
    ├── semantic_precheck → postprocess → [conditional]
    ├── patient → END
    ├── web → postprocess → unmute
    ├── semantic_update → medical → unmute
    └── ui_change → END
```

### 6. Improved Error Handling and Debugging
- **Streaming Error Reporting**: Real-time error messages to frontend
- **Connection Status**: Detailed connection status updates
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for websocket connections
- **Exception Capture**: Comprehensive exception handling with stack traces
- **Debug Logging**: Extensive debug output for troubleshooting

### 7. Session and State Management
- **Session Tracking**: Unique session IDs for each request
- **State Preservation**: Maintains state across parallel execution paths
- **Processing Path Flag**: Tracks which execution path is active
- **Route Tag Persistence**: Maintains routing information throughout workflow

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Enhancements
- **Parallel Processing**: Eliminates sequential bottlenecks
- **Real-time Streaming**: Immediate feedback to users
- **Concurrent Operations**: Voice and agent processing happen simultaneously
- **Reduced Latency**: Faster overall response times

### Architecture Complexity
